# Tasmota TuyaMCU T1-GD-30A Gas Sensor Config
Tasmota Configuration for the Tuya T1-GD-30A Gas Sensor Using TuyaMCU

Note - Before we begin I am not responsible for whatever problems or injuries come from the use of this config. Although the alarm MCU appears to work independently of the ESP8266 (Or TYWE3S), Occam's razer and Murphy's law still apply.
